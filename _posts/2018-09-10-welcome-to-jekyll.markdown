Here's my first post into jekyll github pages. I'm here to talk about Go. As I learn Go, this blog will be pretty simple. I'll talk about beginners mistakes, things to keep in mind, and how I've needed to change my thinking to work with a new language--basically, what I've needed to unlearn from doing C# for 6 years. I've done this with other languages before, but never to the extent I am with Go. With a .NET background, I am fascinated by the simplicity and power of Go and how it has so much baked into the fabric of the language itself. Things like concurrency and lists, which need to be imported into any .NET project. I'll talk more about this in the blog. But for now, I hope you enjoy and benefit from my thoughts.
