## About 'Run Go Run'
<p class="message">Run Go Run is a blog about my thoughts around learning Go as a .NET developer. Transitioning to Golang from C# has involved a lot of unlearning. The typically <i>modus operandi</i> in the .NET world needs to be flipped on its head and rethinking common assumptions and casting out old dogmas is often necessary. As a blog in my journey of learning Go, the focus will be uprooting the paradigmatic practices tacit in OOP and C# and writing about how my thinking is changing as I learn more about Go.

As I'm starting as a beginner at Go, the topics will be very basic at first, and as I learn, they should become more advanced (or else something isn't right.)
