> Though the world does not change with a change of paradigm, the scientist afterward works in a different world. 
- Thomas S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions

<p class="message">When one comes to learn how to speak, read, and write in a natural language, assumptions and theories emerge within the forming mind about how the world works and how the language is used to represent that world. Learning to program is no different. The principles behind the language, who built it, and the intent in the designers of that langauge had instill the language with values about how best to structure ones thinking as one solves problems within the language.</p>

<p class="message">Run Go Run is a blog exploring the Go programming language from somone indoctrinated into C#, born and raised as a .NET developer (born into programming through .NET that is.) As I've gained mastery of C# and OOP, working with it daily, I began to explore other languages to break through the boilerplate code to experience something new. I recently became fascinated with Go as it was far different than what I was used to, and in learning it, I quickly realized I need to shift my thinking with this new language--accept the different world that Go presented.</p>

<p class="message">Transitioning to Go from C# has involved a lot of unlearning. As I've noticed, the typical <i>modus operandi</i> in the .NET world needs to be flipped on its head when learning Go, and one must rethink common assumptions while casting out old dogmas.  As a blog in my journey of learning Go, the focus will be uprooting the paradigmatic practices tacit in OOP and C# and writing about how my thinking is changing as I learn more about Go.
